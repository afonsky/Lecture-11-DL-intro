## E.g. CV on a Simulated Dataset

<div class="flex-1 flex justify-center">
  <div class="centeredText">LOOCV and 10-fold CV</div>
  <img src="/ISLRv2_figure_5.6.png" style="width: 550px;">
</div>


<!-- * LOOCV and $10$-fold CV
  * curves are similar
  * predicted $d$ are similar
  * $10$-fold CV is faster to compute (unless we use leverage shortcut to compute LOOCV)
* The estimated error can be higher or lower than the true test error -->

- curves are similar
- predicted *d* are similar
- 10-fold CV is faster to compute (unless we use leverage shortcut to compute LOOCV)
- The estimated error can be higher or lower than the true test error
